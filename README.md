#2-0-4:

A tribute, a warning and a future :)

- 👋 Hi, we run two main branches of the future: 1984 and an alternative branch: 2084
- 👀 I’m interested in the similarities between my own personal issues and those I see in world 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the cultural and code differences between capitalism, commerce, community and communism
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a structured branches of the future.

Why is it called the 2-0-4?

Corona 19 arrived into the world in late 2020. 
2020 + 64 (base size of a 204 ball pyramid = 2084 

What is the 2-0-4?

The 2-0-4 is a pyramid style subfolder directory structure.
 
(Top of pyramid) 

1 squared = 1 folder can have up to 
2 squared = 4 subdirectories which have 
3 squared = 9 subsequent subdirectories 
4 squared = 16 etc 
5 squared = 25 etc
6 squared = 36 etc 
7 squared = 49 etc
8 squared = 64 etc 

(Base of pyramid)

Why create a sub directory standard? 

- an accepted artificial constraint add to creative implementations
- easier to iterate over?
- weighted path and graph queries more possible 
- it provides a universal representation of choice (a pyramid chosen by you) 
- all tests either produce an integer result
